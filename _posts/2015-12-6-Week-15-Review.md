## Weekly Review (12/6/15)

Week twelve!

Well, this is it. Week fiftenn, and the course is over.

In a sense, it's kind of bittersweet. While I really struggled with the exams this semester (like, really, really struggled), I felt like I learned a ton through sheer perseverance and dedication to the material. The projects themselves were incredibly helpful in this regard: Taking concepts we've discussed in class and really putting them to use, even allowing concepts to interweave with one another in the later part of the course to really bring everything together.

That being said, I was not a big fan of the exams in this class. The exams themselves weighed in on 44% of the final grade in this class, and I feel that a class that's so incredibly programming-heavy shouldn't be evaluated via exam. Everyone develops in different ways, and trying to pipeline all of those ways together in the form of a standardized test is not a good way to represent what someone is capable of in my eyes. 

My grade in this course will probably be a bit on a lower side because of this, but I'm still glad that I took this class and stuck through it for the entire duration of semester, as the things I learned here will prove to be invaluable in my career moving forward. In addition to this, I'm ever thankful for Downing's emphasis on the tools surrounding development as well: Unit testing, continuous integration, and source control were all things that I'd only ever previously flirted with the idea of, but now have a decent amount of experience with.

In closing, I'd say I'd recommend this course. That being said, if you do choose to take this course, be prepared for the workload that comes with it, as it's nothing to sneeze at. Downing is a great lecturer who does a good job to keep the whole class involved while still being respectful to all of the students in the class, but the work associated is no joke. Make sure that you come in with an open mind and time to put into really learning the material if you want to do well. 

## Tip of the Week 

When working on assignments, I can't emphasize the importance of working with others enough. It's significantly easier to cover more material in less time, debug code faster, develop a program design faster.. do just about anything faster, assuming you're working with the right people. While it's nice to occasionally do a project or two by yourself so you can control the flow of work, do not underestimate the power of a group. This semester, the projects I did with partners were ALWAYS significantly less stressful than those that I did by myself.
