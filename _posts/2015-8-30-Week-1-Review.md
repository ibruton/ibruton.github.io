## Weekly Review (8/30/15)

It's Sunday afternoon on the 30th of August, and I've finally managed to set this Jekyll thing up, which means I can now talk about my time in the class this past week! Hooray!

Besides being the only class I have on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, Object Oriented Programming is great so far. Professor Downing structures the course so that the incoming student has a background in programming, but not necessarily in C++. This is great because myself (as well as many other students in the course, I'd assume), have made it through Data Structures (CS 314, a prerequisite to the prerequisite of this class, CS 429), but have no background in the language of C++.

While I'm not the biggest fan of the teaching method Prof. Downing uses (the calling out of students at random to answerom questions), the lectures he has given thus far are very interesting and in-depth, taking time to explain even the most minute things. I feel like this course will give students more than just knowledge in a new language at the end of the day; I think it'll give them a much more in-depth idea of how to approach programming problems as well as a set of tools to use during the development process that they didn't even know they had.

## Tip of the Week

Familiarizing yourself with Git and the commands associated with it will prove to be invaluable to you as you progress in your programming career. The above website is a bare-bones, to-the-point reference site that helps this process.
