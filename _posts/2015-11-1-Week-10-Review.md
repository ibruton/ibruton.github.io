## Weekly Review (11/1/15)

Week ten is in the book. We've reached double digits!

This week was very low-key. Because of the launch of a new project, we spent this Monday covering what exactly the project required of us. In it, we're responsible for simulating Darwin's world given a board size, specific species that control creature movement, and interactions between creatures. While this sounds like something that you'd do in a data structures class, the difficulty in this project comes from the restraint: "You cannot use any getters and setters". This forces us to implement our project via various other means, such as the passing of objects by reference. The project also requires us to implement an iterator, one of my least favorite things to do in all of the programming things I've done. 

On Wednesday, we had Conrad Stoll from Mutual Mobile step in to talk about his company and his time in the industry. It's always cool seeing how various tech companies differ in their implementation of solutions to certain problems, and how the work environment can be so different even if the umbrella of work all of these companies falls under is the same.

Wednesday I unfortunately missed class due to bad weather. We were under a tornado warning 45 minutes before the class began, and upon getting ready to depart for class (in the midst of a storm), a tree branch blew down my road. That combined with the university's status changing to "severe weather: take caution" was enough to spook me out of attendance. That being said, it looks like they covered the utilization and implementation of a generic stack data structure via templates, also touching briefly on the usage of "friend" functions. 

## Tip of the Week 

Buy an umbrella. You never know when it'll be useful. 

No, but seriously, this week I want to talk about motivation again (because it's something I struggle a lot with myself). If you're having issues motivating yourself to get up and go do something, regardless of what it is, find a way to relate it an interest of yours. While sometimes it might be a bit of a stretch and a hard goal to accomplish, it makes the work a lot more bearable; and when you're done, you can take a step back, point and what you've done, and be happy about what you've accomplished.
