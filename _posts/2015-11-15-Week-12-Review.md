## Weekly Review (11/15/15)

Week twelve!

This week was pretty relaxed, as the week after a project usually is. On Monday we went over the project specs for the final project, Life. In it we covered the semantics and how the program itself should flow, as well as a few suggested design patterns and techniques to be used on the solution. It's a lot like Darwin in the sense that we're simulating a board without the utilization of getters and setters, but also adds in the usage of C++ inheritance. Also it calls for the creation of a templated class in an effort to kind of link all of the things we've been doing throughout the semester together into one final project. I'm working on it solo and haven't made quite as much progress as I've wanted so far, but I know that upon completion of it I'll have learned a lot. 

On Wednesday we had someone from Atlassian come out a bit to discuss life and work in the industry. It was a good talk and very informative; probably one of my favorites we've had thus far. It's cool to see how all of the companies differ and how each one has a unique workflow and experience. 

## Tip of the Week 

Don't be afraid to ask questions. If you're in the dark on a topic and you have knowledgeable people around you, ask them questions so that you might no longer be in the dark on that topic! You're never going to be able to be as knowledgeable in a certain field or area of study if you don't take advantage to the resources given to you!
