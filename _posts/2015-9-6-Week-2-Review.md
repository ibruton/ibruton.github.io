## Weekly Review (9/6/15)

Hey all, week two is in the books!

This week in object-oriented programming, we centered pretty much all of our focus on the first project, Collatz. Lecture times are short (under an hour!) and because of this, we really only get enough time to focus on a single subject per class. While this is a tad upsetting as its hard to get really into a subject in 50 minutes, I really like the constant, brief lectures. They force me to really focus and take in the material before the class day ends, and I'm able to really absorb on that one subject covered in class that day. 

Anyways, back to the project. This week we discussed a recommended order of operations at setting up and tackling the project the most efficiently, as well as all of the tools associated with it (Sphere, Travis CI, etc.). It was also mentioned that we'd need to implement a simple, array-based cache to make the obtaining of information easier. This week seemed to really be a way to ease students into the required workflow of the course.

## Tip of the Week 

This should be a given, but I'll state it anyways:

Start your projects early and work on them gradually up until the due date! Rushing through projects two weeks before they're due is almost as bad as cramming them if you don't intend to truly take in all that the project has to offer from an educational standpoint. By working on it a bit up until the due date, it assures you have enough time and allows you to really soak up the information.
