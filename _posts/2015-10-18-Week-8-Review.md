## Weekly Review (10/18/15)

Week eight is in the books, and the class is already around the halfway point. 

Man, time flies. This week we began by going over the logistics and specifics of the latest project, Allocator. It seems to me to be a tad different from the other projects in the sense that it's more about understanding what to do conceptually, rather than how to implement it itself. There are no acceptance tests, and everything is done by filling in the skeleton of a .h file that has been given to us. Adding in the code to complete the given assignment itself seems simple; but if you don't understand the greater scheme of things going into it, you're going to have a bad time.

We only had one quiz this week on Friday. This was because Downing wanted to focus all of our lecture time on the content this week: Project details, arrays, and container implementations. I can understand why he'd want to do this, because when class is only 50 minutes long and a 3-4 question quiz takes almost 10 minutes, you're spending almost a 1/5 of all class time answering questions reviewing previous material. The one quiz we did have was over Arrays, something we had covered prior. This week was pretty standard. It was the week after an exam and the week before a project was due, so I felt while we were still learning, we were in a bit of a "grace period" before the intensity picks back up. 

## Tip of the Week 

I've mentioned this a bit prior, but take care of your mental health. I was not in a good state of mind the days leading up to, and the day of, the exam. Because of this I did MUCH worse than I could have and should have done. While pushing yourself to be as good as you can possibly be is great, give yourself some breathing room as well. Eat regularly, sleep well, and give yourself some downtime from schoolwork every now and then. It's a shame to try so hard and ultimately suffer from it as a result. Be good to yourself.
