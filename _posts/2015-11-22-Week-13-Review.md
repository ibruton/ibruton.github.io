## Weekly Review (11/22/15)

Week twelve!

This week in Object-Oriented Programming we continued to discuss the intricacies of the C++ class system. Monday we took a look at function overriding to analyze just how the language decides when it wants to utilize the parent's function over the child's and vice versa. This was really quite eye-opening, and definitely something that I'll need to study over the Thanksgiving holiday, as it wasn't nearly as clear cut as I had originally anticipated. It's interesting that as we progress farther in the course, Downing's slowly but firmly bringing together all of the topics we've discussed throughout the duration of the class all together into a single lecture.

For instance, it's not uncommon to, while analyzing inheritance and polymorphism, be asked to state the number of copy constructors invoked by which class object, or whether or not an object's destructor is called. This was also seen in the last project of life, in which we utilized "smart" pointers and an entire class hierarchy for our Cells, but also had to incorporate a templated class to tie it all together. 

On Friday we began discussing the idea of a new topic, reflection. While we just briefly touched on this in class on Friday, it appears to be the idea that a program can interpret a class's type and specifics at runtime. This can be useful in the form of instantiation of objects and invoking of specific class methods. 

## Tip of the Week 

Find a group that you're comfortable with to help better yourself for the exam. While studying alone can be effective with a focused mindset, the amount of material that can be covered in a shorter time length with just two people is insane and is definitely recommended, much like working on a project with a partner. The amount of time spent will be less and the amount of work done (or in this case, knowledge retained), will be much greater.
