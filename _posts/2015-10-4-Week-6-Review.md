## Weekly Review (10/4/15)

Week six is done and man what a week it was.

This week we covered some topics that I'd previously heard of once or twice but never really had any experience with: Lambda functions, templates, and iterators. This is interesting to me specifically, because when I originally signed up for the course I was expecting a heavy focus on classes, structs and instances of classes in the form of objects; yet we've only really scratched the surface of that with Range_Iterator and our Voting project. What this says to me is that there's a lot about object-oriented programming that I didn't know about. Fortunately, Professor Downing has already graced us with a review of everything we need to know for the exam coming up Thursday, but this week made me realize that if I don't buckle down and study this week, I'm setting myself up for a bad situation come the first exam on Thursday. Lambda/closure functions, templates, and iterators might be seemingly simple on the surface, but if you don't take the time to really learn them thoroughly they can really throw you off. 

## Tip of the Week 

This week's tip of the week is something that I myself will be doing a lot of this week in preparation for the exam: Experimentation. When you learn a new concept, instead of just jumping into using it into your implementation to solve a problem, take some time to play around with it in some toy code to really examine it and understand how it works. When you jump straight to using something you didn't previously know in a project of yours, sometimes your understanding of what exactly it's doing gets lost in the grand scheme of things. Even though we might not always have the time for it, when you're trying to use something that you don't entirely understand, it would greatly benefit you as a programmer to play around with it until you do. By doing this you'll have not only a more well-rounded idea of what exactly it is you're doing, but also you'll be able to utilize that solution in another problem more effectively and without having to go through the hassle of looking it up again due to your lack of retention.
