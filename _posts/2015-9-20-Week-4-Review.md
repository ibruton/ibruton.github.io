## Weekly Review (9/20/15)

With week four in the books, I'm back again to talk about what we covered in class.

This week was an interesting week as it really covered a lot of content that I was familiar with, but had some uncertainties on. On Monday we discussed project logistics and Professor Downing helped us by walking us through the requirements as well as suggesting (or at least hinting at) a plan of action to take the requirements and turn them into a reality. I always find lectures like this helpful, because not only does it aid you on your project progression, it allows you to take a step back and evaluate some of the concepts that have previously only been examined abstractly and put them into action. 

The remaining two days of this week we looked at more abstract concepts again, this time involving pointers and references (* and &). In these two lectures, Professor Downing presented to us what exactly pointers and references are, how to use them, and when it'd be beneficial to use them. I'm glad we covered this, because, although I've already made my way through CS 439 (OS), I always stumbled a bit with my pointers and references, so these lectures have really helped me to cement my understanding. While I feel like I'm still not 100% on them yet; I can already tell that they'll both be beneficial for me to know moving forward, and also something that I expect to show up on the first exam. However, due to Professor Downing kickstarting my understanding of these concepts, I'm hoping that with a bit of studying up I'll be right where I need to be come exam time.

## Tip of the Week 

This week's tip of the week is to not fret about your ability as a programmer. If you've made it this far in one of the best Computer Science programs in the nation, your ability to accomplish things programmatically is probably pretty good compared to a lot of other CS students in the nation. I'm not saying to stop learning - That's something you should never stop doing - But to not worry about how you stack up to others. The Imposter Syndrome is a very real thing that is prevalent in the CS world, and because computer science covers such a broad range of topics, you're always bound to run into people who know things you don't. However, because of this, there's probably a lot of things you DO know that others might not. I know it's hard (especially in the academic world), but try not to stress over how you compare to other computer science students. No sense in stressing about something that's irrelevant.
