## Weekly Review (11/8/15)

Week eleven is done. This week was very odd for me, because not only did we have our project due this week, I also had a very important statistics exam that I had to prepare myself for. Because of this, this week was very mentally exhausting to me personally. 

However, within the confines of the class, this past week pretty interesting. We looked at our Vector class again and covered function overloading. Downing used vector as an example to show that even though we might be getting some functions for free, their behavior is not always what we might want them to be, and how to fix that to ensure that our code does what we want it to do. After that was all finished up, we started looking a bit more into the idea of class inheritance and how it works. We used the simple example of a "parent" Shape class and "child" Rectangle and Circle classes. I feel a lot more comfortable discussing this type of thing. While I'm a bit confused as to why we're just now getting to it this late in the semester, it is a welcome change from the unknown territory of C++ that we delved into earlier. 

## Tip of the Week 

While it's nice to work with partners on assignments, make sure that you contribute as well. While it might seem easier at times to let your partner do the work since they seem to know what they're doing, you won't learn anything! The best way to learn to program is to do it, so get out and do it!
