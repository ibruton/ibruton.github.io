## Weekly Review (9/13/15)

Hey guys, back again for week number three!

This week was a bit of a shorter week in this class due to labor day; so instead of the usual three lectures, we had just two. On our first lecture for the week, Wednesday, a UT CS alumni came from Bloomberg to talk about life in the industry. While the premise of the talk was to acclimate us to industry life and give us tips and tricks for success during our remaining collegiate careers, I could tell that the presentation was geared toward persuading UT CS students into potentially applying to work/intern there (which is totally okay!). While the talk itself was relatively useful, it was a nice change of pace from the constant fear of being called on in class, and we had no quiz that day.

Speaking of being called on.. The following day I /was/ called on in class, and it about what I was expecting: Stressful and a tad disorienting having to think on the spot like that. While it might work for some, the worry of constantly being called on puts a bit more stress on me than it should. Anyways, on Friday we discussed exceptions and covered the basics in which they work. This is actually pretty interesting to me, as this is a part of my CS background that I learned through trial and error (since it was never fully taught in any of my other classes) and it's nice to see it at a more in-depth level. 

## Tip of the Week 

The tip of the week this week is really more of a re-iteration of what we've been focusing on in class in addition to our learning of parallel programming: The wonders of pair programming. While it has many benefits, from my time in CS 439 I've found that even just having another pair of eyes to look over code as its created can help to cut down on all types of bugs: Logic error, syntax errors, you name it. While the concept might seem a tad convoluted at first, if you give it a chance I think you'll find that it's actually quite productive.
