## Weekly Review (9/27/15)

Week five has now come and gone, so let's take a look at what we covered this week.

This week was cool because we only had one quiz this week. I assume that's because of the career fair on Monday and then the JPL presentation we had this week, but regardless, one quiz a week is always cool with me. In terms of content covered this week, it was a bit more of the same (albeit with added depth) of the content covered last week. This week in lecture (Monday and Friday), we discussed at greater length the utilization of * and & (pointers and references) in our code, as well as the use of typenames to make our functions adaptable to more than just a specific type. I might seem like a broken record here, but this was once again something that was mentioned and covered briefly when I was just learning the ropes of how to program in my earlier classes, so looking at it again with a new and greater sense of understanding is really cool. It's amazing how looking at something that was once ridiculously hard for you grasp after some time can make a lot more sense than you ever thought possible. That being said, I definitely feel like I'll need some practice with these concepts before I grasp them entirely. 

## Tip of the Week 

This week's tip of the week is to make sure you keep your code repos up to date, especially if you're working with a partner. In order to explain this fully (and its importance!), I think I should provide an example. Earlier this week, our second project was due. However, due to the business of both mine and my partner's schedules, we were only able to work together on the project last week, and this week two days before the deadline. However, not wanting to fall behind on the project, I took it upon myself to work on the assignment some individually (so we didn't fall behind), so when we finally were able to work together, we'd still be a lot farther along. Little did I know that my partner was also doing the same thing, and, come the Tuesday before the assignment is due (2 days!), we finally met up and had completely different functions and program structure because one of us hadn't been committing to our repository. Fortunately when we met we were able to combine our functions and get something that worked for us, but I feel it was a lot more painful than it needed to be. Fortunately we made this mistake early on in the class however, so we can make sure it doesn't happen again moving forward.
