## Weekly Review (10/11/15)

Week seven is done and I am so relieved. 

This week we covered the last of the topics that was to be tested over come exam one (which happened this past Thursday). On Monday we went over containers that could utilize the various iterators that we had been creating and experimenting with by creating a container called Range that could be used by the RangeIterator that we had made the past Friday. It was a tad confusing because while the two things are very different, there was a decent amount of overlap and distinguishing between the two was easier said than done. The next class day, we covered various types of consts, that admiteddly at the time, was a bit hard to follow. I'm finding that the further I go in this course, the less I actually know about object-oriented programming. I'm hoping that when all is said and done the stuff I learn in this course will stick with me throughout my entire professional career.

As for the exam: I feel I didn't do nearly as well as I could have, but I didn't really know how to study for it. I assumed that since it was entirely writing C code we'd have to apply iterators in some form or fashion, but I had no idea how to convert that into a study plan. That's alright though, because while the first exam might've been rough I now know what to do to prepare for future exams (assuming they're similar in style to this one). 


## Tip of the Week 

I said it last week, but with the exam out of the way, I think it's important to re-iterate. Experiment with the things you've learned. Learning things is great, but if you never take the time to try them out and use them in things outside of the examples given to you in class, have you really retained the information? The only way to truly understand a concept is to see it in action.
