## Weekly Review (10/25/15)

Week nine is done.

This week was a pretty interesting week. I still can feel the burn of the last exam, but it's a bit less severe now. As I stated in my last few entries, I didn't do nearly as well on the exam as I had originally hoped. Because of this I've really tried to turn it all around moving forward. The past few times I've been called on in class, I've felt quite lost - The exam really shook me up and really made me lose focus, but starting at the end of this week I'm trying to make this a thing of the past. My education is important and spending all of my time mourning an exam that's already come and gone isn't productive in any sense of the word. All I can do is settle in, find out what I'm struggling with, correct it, and stay focused moving forward. 

ANYWAYS, on to what we covered in class!

This week we began to add another layer on top of what we've already covered in the form of vector implementation. It was very interesting to me to see just how closely our knowledge of iterators and templates came into play in our vector example and how by just modifying what we've already written in just a few ways can be applied to something else, something a bit less abstract. We finished off the week by showing how our memory allocator (that we made in our project!) can be used in our homemade vector class. This was a really eye opening experience to me, as it really showed me how closely related all of this stuff is to one another and how everything we're learning are all pieces to a big puzzle in object-oriented languages. 

## Tip of the Week 

This week's tip of the week is on motivation: If you're having issues motivating yourself to get work done on something, try to find a way to relate it to one of your interests! I had the hardest time motivating myself to work on personal projects, but upon finding one that was very relevant to my interests I found motivation to keep going that I didn't even know existed.
